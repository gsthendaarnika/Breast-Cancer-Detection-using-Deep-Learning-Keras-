# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning (Keras)

This project implements a deep learning model to detect breast cancer using the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)** dataset. The Jupyter Notebook covers the entire workflow — from preprocessing to model evaluation — built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.

## 🔍 Features
- Data preprocessing (encoding, normalization, splitting)
- Neural Network model with Dense, Dropout, and BatchNormalization layers
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Visualization of training and validation performance

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📊 Results
The model effectively classifies tumor samples into **benign** and **malignant**, achieving high accuracy with stable training performance.

## 🧾 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file)  
3. Run all cells sequentially
